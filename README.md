# Fed-Rafa-rivalry

This repo is created to analyse the rivalry between two of the greatest tennis players. I have pulled information on their meetings till 2017. 

I, being a Federer fan, want to dismiss the argument that Nadal is the better player of the two because of a better head-to-head. My argument is that the head-to-head favours Nadal because of two reasons:
1. 15 / 38 of their matches have been on clay. Everybody agrees that Nadal is the greatest tennis player on one surface,      which is clay. Thus, having a record of 13-2 in his favour on clay gives him a huge advantage over Federer, who has a better head-to-head over him on other two surfaces.
2. Federer has been consistent in the slams throughout his career, rarely missing out on a slam or finishing before the fourth round, until 2016, when he turned 35. Nadal, on the other hand, has missed some slams in this period and occasionally finished in the first four rounds, losing to inferior opposition compared to Federer. This is shown in the image below:
